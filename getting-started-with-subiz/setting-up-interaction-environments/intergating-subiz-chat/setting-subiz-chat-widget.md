#### **7. Whitelist domain** {#7-whitelist-domain}

**Whitelist domain** is a list of domains that you allow to display the Subiz widget on that page. Pages that not in the whitelist will not be able to display the Subiz widget even when Subiz embed code is placed there.

For example, if you enter domain1.com and domain2.com in whitelist, you can only place embed code to show Subiz widget in these two pages. If you place the embed code in domain3.com, the widget will not display on this page.
