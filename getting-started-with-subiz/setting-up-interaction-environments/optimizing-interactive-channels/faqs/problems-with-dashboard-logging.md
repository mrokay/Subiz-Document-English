### **The agent has been suspended**

**If you are owner account**

Your account has been suspended automatically from Subiz system because you didnâ€™t verify via [Subiz email](https://subiz.com/email.html) within 24 hours from the moment you signed up.

Subiz allows each email to register only one account in system. So, you have to [re-register ](https://dashboard.subiz.com/signup.html)by another email and remember to confirm your account via email.

**If you are not owner account**

Your account was deleted by administrator. You can contact them to add new agent for you from Dashboard.

 Note that new agent has to be created by new email and new username
{% endhint %}
