### **Whitelist domain**

**Whitelist domain** is a list of domains that you allow to display the Subiz widget on that page. Pages that not in the whitelist will not be able to display the Subiz widget even when Subiz embed code is placed there.

For example, if you enter _domain1.com_ and _domain2.com_ in whitelist, you can only place embed code to show Subiz widget in these two pages. If you place the embed code in _domain3.com_, the widget will not display on this page.

{% hint style="info" %}
When the whitelist domain is empty, Subiz widget will display on all pages on which Subiz embed code is placed by default.

Set up whitelist domain helps you control which pages will display the Subiz widget in case embed code is placed on unexpected pages.
