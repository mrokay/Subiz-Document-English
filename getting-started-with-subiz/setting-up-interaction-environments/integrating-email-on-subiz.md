# Integrating Email on Subiz

### Email Forwarding settings on Subiz

Along with [Subiz account](https://app.subiz.com), you are provided an email address in form of abc@mail.subiz.com. All the emails sent to this address are considered as conversations on [Subiz](https://subiz.com/en).

If you forward emails to abc@mail.subiz.com, you also get these emails on [Subiz](https://subiz.com/en). So, you should set up to forward emails automatically from email address you are using. Then you can work with email right on Subiz. Follow 2 steps below:
