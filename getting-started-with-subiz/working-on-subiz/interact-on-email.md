# Interact on Email

Customers interact with you via Subiz and leave their information so that you can send them more models, price lists, promotion policy or company's profile through emails. Instead of log in Gmail to send email to customers, now you can integrate email on Subiz so that you are able to receive and send emails right on Subiz dashboard. As a result, you can completely  follow the transaction history with customers and take a limit on managing information in too many tools.

This instruction will help you to dig deeper on how to work on Email channel.
