# Operating Management

This is the next step you take after setting up the interactive environment.

You create additional member accounts for agents by inviting co-workers to join [Subiz](https://subiz.com/en). Also, create and manage different agent groups.

You then create rules that automatically deliver the conversation to these agents. The rule set is also the way you operate, arrange the interactive work and conduct customer support consultancy for a sales team, customer care.

All detailed instructions on setting up agents and rules for implementing [Subiz](https://subiz.com/en) operations are available at:
