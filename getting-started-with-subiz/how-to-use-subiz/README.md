Note:

* When you have more than one Agent, **if you do not create rules to assign conversations, all conversation will be assigned to Agent owner by default. It means others Agents do not receive notification of new conversations.** 
* You can use sample rules in [rule library](https://docv4.subiz.com/rule-library/).
* You can create multiple rules, [edit and manage rules](https://docv4.subiz.com/rules-management/) to adapt your demand.

To set up a new rule,[ log into your account](https://app.subiz.com/login) and go to [**Setting&gt; Account&gt; Message&gt; Rule**](https://app.subiz.com/settings/rule-setting) **&gt;** Select **New rule.**

![](https://docv4.subiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/condition.png)

You can set one or more conditions based on **List of rule condition**.

Note: A rule works only when the conversation and the user who starts it meet the conditions \(a conversation is only assigned according to one rule\).

Step 3: Set up how to assign conversations to agents

Select Agent\(s\) who will receive and take over conversations that meet the conditions set above.

![](https://docv4.subiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/assign-to.png)

**1. Assign to Agent\(s\) or a group:**

Any agent in the assigned group can participate in conversations simultaneously.

Select one of the methods below:

* _**Assign to all available agents:**_ assign conversations to all active agents
* _**Assign to specific agent\(s\):**_ assign conversations to one or several agents. Click \(+\), \(-\) to select/deselect Agent. As the example below, 2 Agent has been selected.

![](https://docv4.subiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/rule-example-1.png)

* _**Assign to group\(s\):**_ assign conversations to a group which is created before. As the example below, conversations are assigned to group Sale.

![](https://docv4.subiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/rule-example-3.png)

### RULE MANAGEMENT

When there are **changes in the number of agents, products or channels**, you should adjust the rules to assign conversations more suitably. Avoid overload for certain agents or assignment not fit the Agent’s major.

You can **reorder rules**, **edit existing rules** and **remove rules** that no longer match the current requirements of your business.

![](https://docv4.subiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/all.png)

#### **1. Reorder rules**

Rules work with the **priority order from up to down**.

For example, if a new conversation satisfies the condition of Rule 1, the conversation will be assigned to Agent\(s\) of rule 1. If Rule 1 does not satisfy, it will continue to check Rule 2, 3, etc… in turn.

Note: Only Active rules can work.

To reorder the rules, click **Reorder**.
