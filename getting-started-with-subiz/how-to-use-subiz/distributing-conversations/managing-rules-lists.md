# Managing rule's lists

When there are **changes in the number of agents, products or channels**, you should adjust the rules to assign conversations more suitably. Avoid overload for certain agents or assignment not fit the Agent’s major.

You can **reorder rules**, **edit existing rules** and **remove rules** that no longer match the current requirements of your business.

You need to pay attention and do 3 things:

### **1. Reorder rules**

Rules work with the **priority order from up to down**.

For example, if a new conversation satisfies the condition of Rule 1, the conversation will be assigned to Agent\(s\) of rule 1. If Rule 1 does not satisfy, it will continue to check Rule 2, 3, etc… in turn.
