# Some common assignment rule

### Assignment conversation base on business hours 

Along with applying the Subot and dividing the rule by the business hours of the business, you can automate response to their message and also ask their information. Therefore, you can contact the user the next day.

### Assignment conversation by agent's shift/working day of the week 

You have multiple agents and divided by different shifts according to the working day of the week. You could set up the rule to distribute automatically according to Agent's fixed schedule. 

For example, Agent Chi Trinh receives a chat on days 2, 4, 6 and Sunday and agent Linh Le receives a chat on days 3, 5, 7. You will install 2 Rules as follows:

* _**Rule 1:** Assignment conversation for agent Chi Trinh._
