# Rule setting

**Rules are used to automatically assign incoming messages to specific agent\(s\) or team.** You need to set up rules right after creating account so that you can get conversations from your customers.

Note:

* When you have more than one Agent, **if you do not create rules to assign conversations, all conversation will be assigned to Agent owner by default. It means others Agents do not receive notification of new conversations.**
* You can use sample rules in [rule library](https://docv4.subiz.com/rule-library/).
* You can create multiple rules, [edit and manage rules](https://docv4.subiz.com/rules-management/) to adapt your demand.

To set up a new rule, [log into your account](https://app.subiz.com/login) and go to [**Setting&gt; Account&gt; Message&gt; Rule**](https://app.subiz.com/settings/rule-setting) **&gt;** Select **New rule.**![](https://docv4.subiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/New-rule-1.png)

Then start to set up a new rule.![](https://docv4.subiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Create-rule.png)

Step 1: Enter rule name and description

* **Rule Name:** Enter rule name so that you can easily manage in the rule list
* **Description**: Describe the condition and purpose of the rule

Step 2: Select conditions for the rule

* Click **Add more condition** to combine multiple conditions in a rule.
* Select **And / Or** to determine the relationship between the conditions.

You can set one or more conditions based on **List of rule condition**.

Note: A rule works only when the conversation and the user who starts it meet the conditions \(a conversation is only assigned according to one rule\).

Step 3: Set up how to assign conversations to agents

Select Agent\(s\) who will receive and take over conversations that meet the conditions set above.![](https://docv4.subiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/assign-to.png)

**1. Assign to Agent\(s\) or a group:**

Any agent in the assigned group can participate in conversations simultaneously.

Select one of the methods below:

* _**Assign to all available agents:**_ assign conversations to all active agents
* _**Assign to specific agent\(s\):**_ assign conversations to one or several agents. Click \(+\), \(-\) to select/deselect Agent. As the example below, 2 Agent has been selected.

* _**Assign to group\(s\):**_ assign conversations to a group which is created before. As the example below, conversations are assigned to group Sale.

* _**Assign to agent\(s\) who has last activity with user:**_ assign conversation to agent\(s\) who have the latest conversation with user

**2. Round robin conversation assignment**

Conversations will be assigned one by one to selected agents.

For example, you select 3 agents in the agent list, when there are 6 conversations, each Agent will receive 2 conversations in turn.![](https://docv4.subiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/rule-example-3.png)
