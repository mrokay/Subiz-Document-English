# How to distribute conversations

**With Subiz, conversations to automatically distributed to one or more Agents, by setting up and using rules.**

You can use the original default rule, use the existing Rule Library, or create a "New Rule" to automatically deliver conversations that match the actual needs of the business.

### Use the original default rule

The Rule distributes all interactions of all users to the Agent owner immediately after integrating one or more interactive channels into your Subiz account. **This is the default rule, Subiz has set up for all accounts.**

### Create new Rule

You should rely on the actual situation of the business, such as the number of websites, fan page, email integration, number of agents are using and how to manage and operate the business to create new rules, help for the distribution and handling of the conversation to be effective.

{% hint style="info" %}
* When you have multiple agents, do not create rules to distribute interactively, other agents will not receive the request to chat with the client, then the chat requests are forwarded to the agent account holders. At first, you can select the rules in the Rule Library that Subiz has created.
* You can create multiple rules, manage rules and change rules base on time, to match the number of agents and your management.
