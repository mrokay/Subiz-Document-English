# How to enhance interactions

### INTRODUCTION OF AUTOMATION

In detail, you can install the Automation to send targeted auto messages to the right user at the right time.

#### What is the condition of Automation?

You can create Automation with one or more concurrent conditions.

#### Which action is taken?

Each Automation will take only one action.

With the Subiz Chat channel, you can take one of two actions:

* **Send message to user:** You can send an auto message as soon as customers enter your website, or send a specific message to specific customers.
* **Ask for email address**: It can be used when you are not online or cannot answer immediately. Customers will enter their email address so that you can contact later.

With Email channel, you can take action **Send email to users**. This action only can be taken with users whom you have already got their email.
