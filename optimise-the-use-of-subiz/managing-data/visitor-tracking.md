The IP address is associated with ISP \(Internet Service Provider\) and is constantly changing. Therefore, the IP address will be changed and different from real-time location of user.

Twice a year, Subiz periodically updates IP address data to improve accuracy and commit accuracy to 95% of Country location and to 75% City / Province location.

Subiz identifies users IP address based on Maxmind data. This is the most accurate data of the world on IP address to Location and NASA also uses this data.

If the user's IP address is not correct, you can send a request directly to Maxmind to update it correctly: [https://support.maxmind.com/geoip-data-correction-request/](https://support.maxmind.com/geoip-data-correction-request/)
