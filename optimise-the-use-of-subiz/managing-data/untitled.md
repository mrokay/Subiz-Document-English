# Edit and update user's information

Update and edit user information

The User is the customer that has contacted you via Subiz, including customers interacting with you on the website, from Fanpage and Email. The user list is displayed in the first left pane on the Activity page.

On the Activities page, you can simultaneously monitor the list of users, the history of each user's activity and contact with them directly.

### User list

The list of users displayed is the user that has been assigned to you. Alternatively, you can use the filter to search for users by segment and check the list of unassigned users.
