### Notes for creating Automation sending messages

* You can design [creative automatic messages with Markdown](https://help-en.subiz.com/optimise-the-use-of-subiz/how-to-enhance-interactions/create-automation-message-with-markdown) to draw the attention of your visitors.
* An automation appears only once with 1 visitor. You can create multiple automation to send messages depending on the company's strategy.
* When visitors visit the website, the [Subiz chat](https://subiz.com/live-chat.html) widget will pop up with the automated messages.

If the visitor does not "hide" this[ Subiz](https://subiz.com/en) widget, the next automated message will be announced in numbers, located at the top left of the chat window. When visitors click on that notification message, all messages will be displayed.

If the visitor "hide" the chat window and reads the next pages where you have setted up the automatic message, the message will display as a preview.
